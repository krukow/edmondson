    "# Spidercats: psychological safety and generative culture readout\n",
    "Note: \"Spidercats\" is a fictional team-name used for the purpose of this example report.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "In Nov 2020, we’ve measured two aspects of the work environment and culture in the Spidercats engineering team: (i) the degree of psychological safety; and (ii) the degree to which our culture can be considered “generative.” This document provides an overview of these concepts as well as the results of the surveys used to measure these.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is psychological safety and generative culture?\n",
    "**Psychological safety** expresses the degree to which individuals on our team perceive the work environment as safe to take interpersonal risk, e.g., speaking up with non-confirmative opinions in meetings, asking questions, and asking for help. [Research by Amy Edmondson](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Organization-Psychological-Workplace-Innovation/dp/1119477247) as well as “[Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)”, a large study from Google, has shown that a high degree of psychological safety is an important aspect of effective teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to this is the concept of a **generative culture** which was popularized by the [Accelerate book](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) and The “[State of DevOps](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html)” research reports. This model of culture considers culture as being on a spectrum ranging from “pathological” (power-oriented) to “bureaucratic” (rule-oriented) to “generative” (performance-oriented) cultures. In Accelerate it was shown that organizations with generative culture have higher levels of job satisfaction, as well as achieve higher levels of organizational performance (ability to deliver on the goals they set).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The survey\n",
    "We’ve measured the concepts of psychological safety and generative culture within the Spidercats team using a [set of valid and reliable survey questions](https://forms.gle/ByXsuvB614vopVVF7) taken from the research of Amy Edmondson (The Fearless Organization) and Forsgren et. al (Accelerate).\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement represents a snapshot as of November 17, 2020. The Spidercats engineering team (including engineering managers but excluding eng. director) was surveyed with 100% participation rate (22/22 respondents)."

    "## Defining a model of the survey\n",
    "The survey model is an important concept in the Edmondson library. The model defines the \"topics\" being surveyed (sometimes called \"constructs\"). Each topic declares how it will be processed in the analysis (e.g. scored quantitatively).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the \"Psychological safety\" construct declares: \n",
    "1. a name (\"Psychological safety\");\n",
    "2. a unique set of survey question, e.g. \"I am able to bring up problems and tough issues.\" (implicitly prefixed with \"How much do you agree or disagree with the following statement(s)?\");\n",
    "3. a default scoring map (agree-disagree-7-pt-params) and a default scale (default-scale).\n",
    "4. optionally, each question can override the defaults and state that it must be scored using another scale (e.g. \"I worry that mistakes will be held against me.\" is scored with the `negative-scale` since \"Strongly agree\" is the worst possible answer to this question).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see below, psychological safety and generative culture are scored using a 7-pt Likert scale with some questions reverse scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "For \"Psychological safety domains\" and \"Open-ended feedback\" we don't do quantitative analysis. For these we simply gather peoples responses (the `:groups` and `:verbatims` keywords declare this, and the usage is explained later in this document)."
